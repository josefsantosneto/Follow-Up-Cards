#Follow Up Cards

This application was developed from scratch by Jose Faustino dos Santos Neto and its first version was named project Visual Management.
This project was built with more resources than the previous version, and some changes in the database architecture. In addition, more options of filter were added in the Running Projects (“Projetos em andamento”).
 It still has got the same front-end of Visual Management, but the new visual is under construction.
